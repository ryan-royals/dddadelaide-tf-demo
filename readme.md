# DDD Adelaide 2023 Terraform Demo

Hi!

Your either here after my talk at DDD Adelaide 2023, or you found it on your own. Either way, welcome!

Just a simple nothing Terraform deployment, trying to use most of the basic Terraform features.  
If you have questions, feel free ask here or where ever you find me.

Don't forget to checkout the Docs folder, as I have a Terraform Style guide and a list of tips and tricks.
